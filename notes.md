# Fabricius 
Using an image I found off the internet, I started working on the Fabricius website to translate a small section of the image I selected.

## Pros
- The program is easy to use and the tutuorial is filled with visual assistance (though I would have like an audio track to go with it)
- It identifies possible options of hieroglyphs saving time going back and forth to look up each symbol


## Cons
- Overall I found this to be something that can't be easily used by your avarage Joe, specifically because of the erase and draw tool. I had difficulty drawing and erasing due to small glitches while I was using a mouse and a pen (Surface Pro just in case the model makes a difference)
- I also feel that there are some judgement calls that I had to make due to the limitations of my image and my knowledge, so it is possible I erasered some small part of the image simply because it looks like a chip or something along those lines.
- I am having issues with the Sequence section due to the very tight fitted words (so I had to erase and retrace a few times), and because I am unable to find how to identify each piece that I have sectioned off to translate. 
- Finding the correct hieroglyph from the suggestion list is a bit difficult due to my lack of knowledge and the many options.
