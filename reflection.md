I found the Fabricius activity reminded me a lot fo the discussion last week (or maybe it was the week prior) where replication and the issues related were prominent. Though the idea of Fabricius is great in theory, I found that (like anything) it could be better/it was just a tad too advanced for just anyone to experience. The reason I say this is because of two things. The first is the fact that I had to go in and actually draw/correct the image so that there was nothing to interfere with the AI recognizing the hieroglyph. This requires (to an extent) experience with art and drawing so that you can create acurate depictions. The second thing that was a bit of an issue was the auto-recognition feature. I am not well versed in hieroglyphes as mentioned, so if the software could not find the image I would have to go through the options it suggests, and if that didn't work then I'd just have to go through each possible option. So this would just take a very long time for someone to do, and seeing as my image had hundreds of hieroglyphs to edit and recognize, it would have been a very time consuming process. However, the program is very clear and easy to use otherwise, and I can see it being a great way to spread data and incorporate more people, which is what this module is about (COMMUNICATION!) So I am excited to fidle around with it more and hopefully if more people do that the program will get better at recognizing each symbol more accuratly.
